Testing Approach considered for this test:

Scenario 1: While registering, if the email address is incorrect. User should see an error message

1. I have created a Authentication page class for storing all the elements and their functions related to Authentication page.
That can include 'Create an account' and 'Sign in' feature.


Scenario 2: Check whether Megamenu works (Dresses -> Summer dresses)

1. I have created a scenario outline with Examples for this test. Hence this test can be reused for any other menu navigations by just passing menu option in the Example and by providing the path of those values.
2. Since this menu navigation is available across all the pages, I have added the methods under Register page class and it can be used across other pages as well.


Best Practices Suggestions:
1. It's good to create a common library for validation/ assertion purpose.
Ex creating a common function for click operation.
For validating the page title.
For validation of element to be displayed
For navigating to a page etc.

This would help in re-usability of the code. Less lines of codes and hence more maintainable.

2. Parallel execution would also help in saving the execution time. 
3. Having Test IDs for elements will be a more robust way of ensuring element locator is working fine and less dependency on class which may change and break the tests.
